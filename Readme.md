# TextRecognizer

#### Experiment-1

The goal of this experiment will be simple which is to solve a simplified version of line text recognition problem, a character recognizer.

The dataset we will be using for this task will be [EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset), which thanks [Cohen and et al](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05373) it is labelled.

We will experiment with different network architectures while training the model.
